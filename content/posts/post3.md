## What is the OSI Model?

The OSI model or Open Systems Interconnection model is a standard that provides a bases for how computer systems interact on the network from physical electrical impulses to interacting with the data on your screen. The OSI model is made up of seven layer:

|Layer|Name|
|:-:|:-:|
|7|Application|
|6|Presentation|
|5|Session|
|4|Transport|
|3|Network|
|2|Data Link|
|1|Physical|

Each layer plays an important part in getting data from one system to another.
